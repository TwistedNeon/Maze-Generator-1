The only two values you need to adjust to generate different mazes is the canvas size and density of the maze(variables at very top of code). Preferably try and make sure the density divides evenly into the canvas size but it will still work even if it doesn't divide perfectly. This is my first p5 library project and it took me about 5.5 hours to make. Most of that time was spent referencing the p5 library doc as well as wikipedia pages about maze generation and a few youtube videos by the coding train. A cool addition to this would be to make a maze solver algorithm and make it solve the newly generated maze after it's done.
